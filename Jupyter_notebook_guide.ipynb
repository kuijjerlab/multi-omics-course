There are three types of cells: markdown cells, which recognise standard markdown syntax and when run, they will convert markdown code into formatted text. Code cells, which will recognise and run code depending on the kernel selected (in our case, R code). Finally, there are raw text cells, which will simply print raw text. \n",
