    "# Workshop: Modeling and comparing brain cancer regulatory networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you will learn how to model and analyze PANDA networks with the netZooR package. As a use case, we will compare primary brain cancers with recurrent brain cancer. The latter means a recurrence after removal of the primary tumor. Recurrent tumors are often more aggressive, as they arise from cells that resisted treatment. With network analysis, we aim to understand the regulatory mechanisms involved in this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Module 1**, you will learn to model a regulatory network with PANDA. We will start with investigating the input motif prior, protein-protein interactions, and expression dataset and make sure to preprocess these datasets correctly so that they can be used with PANDA. Then, we will run PANDA on the complete dataset that includes both primary tumors and recurrences, to model an aggregate network representing all brain cancer samples as a whole. We will evaluate how changing various parameters in the PANDA program affect the output network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 2** will focus on comparative network analysis. First, we will run PANDA on primary and recurrent tumors separately, so that we obtain one aggregate network representing primary brain cancer and one aggregate network representing recurrent brain cancer. We will extract network edges that are most different between the two aggregate networks and look at the genes and transcription factors that are connected by these edges. We will also investigate some network centrality metrics (TF degrees and gene degrees) to check which TFs/genes differ most. After having compared the aggregate networks, we will apply LIONESS on the complete brain cancer dataset to estimate single-sample networks. We will calculate gene and TF degrees and compare these between the two sample groups of interest with a statistical approach (LIMMA).\n",

    "Before we begin, we need to load the libraries we will use. This may take a few minutes."

    "PANDA's input consists of three data types. Below is some information on the datasets that we prepared for this workshop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `prior` A \"prior\" regulatory network of putative TF-gene interactions. Here, we will be working with a motif prior that we previously built by scanning known TF motifs to promoter regions in the human genome. In this file, the first column indicates the TF, the second column the target gene, and the third column a \"1\" indicating a putative interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `exp` Gene expression data. Gene expression data and gene annotations were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession ID GSE62153. This dataset contains gene expression data obtained from microarrays that were used to profile primary and recurrent brain cancer. These data were downloaded with the R package GEOquery and then normalized and log transformed. Rows indicate probe IDs and columns sample names.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `ppi` Potential protein-protein interactions (PPI) between TFs (optional). PPI data is optional in PANDA. Here, we downloaded data from StringDb, which contains scores in the range of [0,1000] indicating potential PPIs. We filtered these for TFs present in the motif prior and transformed scores to scores [0,1]. The first column indicates a TF, the second the TF it binds, and the third the interaction score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the message passing nature of PANDA, running the method on genome-wide data can be quite slow (depending on the available computing resources). We generally recommend to run PANDA on genome-wide data (i.e. including all genes for which expression data is available). However, to ensure it is feasible to run PANDA and explore its output multiple times during the limited time frame of this workshop, we subsetted the expression data to the so-called L1000 genesâ€”978 \"landmark\" genes that should capture most of the variability in the human genome (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990023/ for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we also included the object `anno` that consists of annotation for the microarray probe identifiers and `clin` that includes clinical features for the patient samples used in this study. These were both obtained from the GEO dataset.\n",

    "Let's examine the input datasets. We start with the motif prior.\n",

In this case, we would like to select edges that are both likely to be \"real\" in a particular network (i.e. have a high edge weight) as well as \"different\" between the two networks. Because the weights of PANDA edges can be thought of as z-score units, edge-weights can be easily converted into probability values. Under this framework, we can multiply the probability that an edge is \"real\" by the probability that it is \"different\" between two networks to get a combined probability score representing whether an edge is both real and different. We can then select edges based on this combined probability score. In our example, we use the PANDA output matrices to select edges that have at least a 75% chance of being both real and different:"
