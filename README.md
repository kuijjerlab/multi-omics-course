# NCMM multi-omics course - Gene Regulatory Network Workshop
Repository for the gene regulatory network analysis workshop taught as part of the NCMM multi-omics course. This repository contains all the information and material needed for this workshop.

* **Jupyter_notebook_guide** contains a brief introduction to using Jupyter notebooks in Jupyter Lab.  
* **multi-omics-instructions** contains a brief set of instructions for the students to get set up for the workshop.  

There is both a Jupyter notebook and a html version of both of these. The html versions should be provided to students before the workshop (on Canvas or similar). They should also be briefly presented at the start of the workshop.

* **input_data.RData** contains all the data needed for this workshop.  
* **multi-omics_workshop.ipynb** is the notebook that is provided to the students to work in This has some background information and explanations, as well as questions for the students to answer throughout the workshop.  
* **multi-omics_workshop_full_code.ipynb** This is a version of the above notebook with all questions answered. This is to help the TAs answer questions and should not be made available to the students until the final hour of the workshop.   

The above three files should be uploaded to the course VMs.
